# Minimal Gameboy Project

This repository gives a basic example of how to get a minimal .gb file created for GBDK 2020.

Everything is made using The [2020 GBDK](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) and the C Programming Language.

The gameboy .gb ROM file can be created by running the make.bat file. The ROM file can be ran in a emulator like [BGB](https://bgb.bircd.org/).
